# Minecraft on Blockchain paper
[The document](WHITEPAPER.md) describes proposals for the implementation of decentralized fully functional minecraft world.

## Annotation
I am not a professional cryptosystem developer. Everything stated in this white paper is my vision of the implementation of a decentralized system that ensures the operation of a full-fledged minecraft world.

I regard this document as a call to start a discussion about the implementation of a decentralized fully functional independent minecraft world.

I find this project socially important. I am not looking for potential benefits for me. If anyone else implements this project, I will be glad. Thus, the using or implementation of any ideas and concepts from this document is welcome.

## Contribution

Any contribution is welcome: technical comments, pull requests, issues, translations into other languages, advice on who to contact for help in the implementation of the project.

To make changes directly to white paper, fork, make changes and submit a pull request.
